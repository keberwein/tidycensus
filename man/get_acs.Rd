\title{Obtain data and feature geometry for the five-year American Community Survey}
\usage{
get_acs(geography, variables = NULL, table = NULL, cache_table = FALSE,
  year = 2016, endyear = NULL, output = "tidy", state = NULL,
  county = NULL, geometry = FALSE, keep_geo_vars = FALSE,
  summary_var = NULL, key = NULL, moe_level = 90, survey = "acs5", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{geography}{The geography of your data.}

\item{variables}{Character string or vector of character strings of variable
IDs. tidycensus automatically returns the estimate and the
margin of error associated with the variable.}

\item{table}{The ACS table for which you would like to request all variables.  Uses
lookup tables to identify the variables; performs faster when variable
table already exists through \code{load_variables(cache = TRUE)}.}

\item{cache_table}{Whether or not to cache table names for faster future access.
Defaults to FALSE; if TRUE, only needs to be called once per
dataset.  If variables dataset is already cached via the
\code{load_variables} function, this can be bypassed.}

\item{year}{The year, or endyear, of the ACS sample. 2010 through 2016 are
available. Defaults to 2016.}

\item{endyear}{Deprecated and will be removed in a future release.}

\item{output}{One of "tidy" (the default) in which each row represents an
enumeration unit-variable combination, or "wide" in which each
row represents an enumeration unit and the variables are in the
columns.}

\item{state}{The state for which you are requesting data. State
names, postal codes, and FIPS codes are accepted.
Defaults to NULL.}

\item{county}{The county for which you are requesting data. County names and
FIPS codes are accepted. Must be combined with a value supplied
to `state`.  Defaults to NULL.}

\item{geometry}{if FALSE (the default), return a regular tibble of ACS data.
if TRUE, uses the tigris package to return an sf tibble
with simple feature geometry in the `geometry` column.  state, county, tract, block group,
block, and ZCTA geometry are supported.}

\item{keep_geo_vars}{if TRUE, keeps all the variables from the Census
shapefile obtained by tigris.  Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{summary_var}{Character string of a "summary variable" from the ACS
to be included
in your output. Usually a variable (e.g. total population)
that you'll want to use as a denominator or comparison.}

\item{key}{Your Census API key.
Obtain one at \url{http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html}}

\item{moe_level}{The confidence level of the returned margin of error.  One of 90 (the default), 95, or 99.}

\item{survey}{The ACS contains one-year, three-year, and five-year surveys expressed as "acs1", "acs3", and "acs5".
The default selection is "acs5."}

\item{...}{Other keyword arguments}
